In ASP.NET Core 7.0, you can intercept and obtain header information like `pc_session_id` by creating custom middleware. Middleware is a series of components that are invoked in the request pipeline, and it allows you to inspect and modify requests and responses. Here's how you can intercept the headers in a custom middleware:

1. Create a new class for your middleware. This class should implement the `IMiddleware` interface. You can do this by creating a class that implements the `InvokeAsync` method. The `InvokeAsync` method will be called for every HTTP request.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class CustomHeaderMiddleware : IMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        // You can access request headers like this
        if (context.Request.Headers.ContainsKey("pc_session_id"))
        {
            string pcSessionId = context.Request.Headers["pc_session_id"];
            // Do something with pcSessionId
        }

        // Call the next middleware in the pipeline
        await next(context);
    }
}
```

2. Register your custom middleware in the `Startup.cs` class:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Other service registrations

    services.AddTransient<CustomHeaderMiddleware>();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<CustomHeaderMiddleware>();

    // Other middleware and routing configuration
}
```

3. Now, when an HTTP request is made, the `CustomHeaderMiddleware` will intercept it and check for the existence of the `pc_session_id` header. You can perform any desired logic with the header value within this middleware.

Make sure to configure the middleware in the desired order in your application's middleware pipeline.

By using this approach, you can intercept and obtain header information like `pc_session_id` from incoming HTTP requests in ASP.NET Core 7.0.
